    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we reviewed some basic statistics about the countries of the world based on the CIA World Factbook.  Due to some quirks of the data such as \"countries\" with zero population and an entry for the entire world, we had to manipulate our queries a bit, but in the end we were able to answer all of the questions about the countries having the highest and lowest populations and population densities. \n",
    "\n",
    "With 48 occupants, the Pitcairn Islands came in as the country with the lowest population.  Unsurprisingly, the country with the highest population is China at 1,367,485,388 people.  Turning to population growth, we actually found that Greenland has approximately zero growth and dug a little deeper into that to verify such an unexpected result.  Showing the highest growth rate was South Sudan 4.02 people per 1000. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our last question, we wanted to find countries that had the highest population.  We looked at this in 2 ways. First, we found the average population and land areas (still excluding the rows with the world and zero populations).  The average population came out to 32,377,011 people and the average land area is 550643.76 square km.   looking at countries with above average populations and below average land areas, Bangladesh appeared to be the highest density country with 1297 people per square kilometer. This method turned out to be flawed, however, as it excluded countries with below average populations but extremely small land area and countries with larger than average land area and very high populations. Removing the restrictions we found that the highest density is actually Macau with 21168 people per square kilometer. \n",
