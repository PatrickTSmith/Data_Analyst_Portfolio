# CIA World Factbook Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to explore and analyze data from the CIA World Factbook. By utilizing SQL queries in Jupyter Notebook, we aim to uncover insights about countries, including their populations, population growth rates, average values, and population densities. 

## Installation and setup
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
2. Download the notebook file "CIA_Factbook_Analysis.ipynb".
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the downloaded file.

### Source Data
The primary data source for this analysis is the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), which provides comprehensive information about countries worldwide.

## Analysis Steps

1. Connecting to the Database: We establish a connection to the SQLite database using the SQLite library in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Overview of the Data: We examine the structure of the 
3. database and explore the content of the "facts" table to familiarize ourselves with the available information.
4. Summary Statistics: We calculate the minimum and maximum populations, as well as the minimum and maximum population growth rates, to gain insights into the range of values.
5. Exploring Average Population and Area: We determine the average population and average land area of countries, excluding outliers like Antarctica and the world population.
6. Finding Densely Populated Countries: We identify the countries with above-average populations and below-average land areas, providing a glimpse into the most densely populated regions of the world.

## Results and evaluation
Throughout the analysis of the CIA World Factbook data, we have obtained several noteworthy results and insights. Here are the key findings:

1. Population Extremes: Pitcairn Islands have the lowest population, with just 48 inhabitants. On the other hand, China has the highest population, with approximately 1,367,485,388 people.

2. Population Growth Rates: Greenland exhibited a near-zero population growth rate, which prompted further investigation. By delving deeper into the data, we found that Greenland's birth rate was balanced by its death rate and negative migration rate, resulting in a relatively stable population. South Sudan had the highest population growth rate at 4.02 people per 1000.

3. Average Population and Area: Excluding Antarctica and the world population, we calculated the average population to be approximately 32,377,011 people and the average land area to be around 550,643.76 square kilometers.

4. Population Density: Initially, we identified Bangladesh as the country with the highest population density at 1,297 people per square kilometer. However, when we removed the restrictions based on average population and area, we discovered that Macau topped the list with a density of 21,168 people per square kilometer.

## Future work
To expand on the CIA World Factbook analysis, several areas can be explored:

1. Comparative Analysis: Conduct a comparative analysis of countries across different metrics, such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, or education levels, to identify correlations and patterns.
2. Temporal Changes: Use data from other years to investigate changes over time.
3. Regional Analysis: Focus on specific regions or continents to understand variations in population trends, economic development, and social indicators.
4. Combine with other data such as the world happiness report or environmental data. 
5. Data Visualization in Power BI, Python or SQL.
