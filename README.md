## About Me
Hi. I'm Patrick, a passionate data analyst based in Richardson, TX. I love diving into data, improving processes, and delivering valuable insights that drive business success.

With a strong background in desktop support, service desk, and technical services engineering, I've honed my skills in data modeling, collection, KPI dashboards, and process optimization. I'm fluent in tools like Excel, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and SQL.

When I'm not crunching numbers, you'll find me exploring my hobbies. I'm an avid reader and enjoy solving puzzles and games, especially board games. I also love off-road biking and hiking in nature. Spending time with my two dogs at the dog park brings me immense joy.
