# Data Analyst Portfolio

This repository is a collection of my best projects from the Data Analyst Path that I finished on [Dataquest.io](https://app.dataquest.io/verify_cert/L851G8R495K0I52XGW5S/), as well as my own Personal Projects.  They are mostly done in Python, specifically in Jupyter Notebooks, with some done with Microsoft Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.
